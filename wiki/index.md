# superluminal
### `C<-`
Superluminal is a minimal node based wiki. It's intended to be very hackable, and simple while still having some super neat features. 

## Features
 - a decent markdown wiki
 - live reloading of pages as you edit the wiki or superluminal itself
 - inline javascript evaluation
 - superluminal-state injection (doesn't work yet!)
 - wiki files can modify your filesystem
 - wow
